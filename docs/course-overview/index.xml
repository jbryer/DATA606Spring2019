      <description>We will make use of R, an open source statistics program and language. Be sure to install R and RStudio on your own computers within the first few days of the class.
 R - Windows or Mac RStudio - Download Windows or Mac version from here LaTeX - Windows use MiKTeX or Mac use BasicTeX (it is best to use Safari to download this file as Chrome or Firefox will often fail)  If using Windows, you also need to download and install these:</description>

      <description>These are some useful resources on the web for learning R. Feel free to suggest other resources by clicking the &amp;ldquo;Improve this page&amp;rdquo; button in the top right.
Learning R  R for Data Science. Book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham Quick-R. Kabakoff&amp;rsquo;s website. Great reference along with his book, R in Action. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Try R. Great tutorial on R where you can try R commands directly from the web browser.</description>

      <description>Occasionally you will need to type equations in homework and labs. R Markdown supports LaTeX style equations using the MathJax javascript library. I do not expect you to learn LaTeX for this course. Instead, I recommend using the free application [Daum Equation Editor](). It availabe online, as a Google Chrome Extension, or as a standalone Mac Application.
